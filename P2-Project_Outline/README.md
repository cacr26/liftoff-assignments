## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project is a bill tracker that allows users to consolidate all their bills expenses to one location.  The bills will be
organized by due date/amount/type/interest rate (if revolving date).  All bills will be able to be created, edited, and deleted.
Users will be able to review history of their bills to allow for comparison to current bills.

I wanted to do this project because of my history will bill organization.  My credit has improved tremendously over the years but
I know that bills can be stressful if people do not have them under control.  Hopefully, this project is a stepping stone to creating
other organizational apps.

### Technologies

- Python
- MySQL
- Django

### What I'll Have to Learn
I have little experience with Python but I am confident that I can learn it rather 
quickly.  The Django framework is completely new for me so it will be completely foreign. Both 
will be a learning experience.
